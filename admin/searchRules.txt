Each term will be processed SEPARTELY!

Searching for "Brian Maurer" will search in all fields for both "Brian" and "Maurer".

If you want to search a specific field for something you can use the following:
(Where <text> is equal to your term)
First Name: "fname:<firstName>"
Last Name: "sname:<lastName>"
Username: "uname:<userName>"
Start Date: "sdate:<startDate>" (date has to be in YYYY-MM-DD format!!, if it isn't it will be thrown out!)
Started BEFORE: "sbefore:<startedBefore>"
Started AFTER: "safter:<startedAfter>"
Company: "company:<company>"
Department: "dept:<department>"
ADP ID: "adp:<adpid>"

You can search for multiple terms in each field as well!  Suppose you wanted to search for people with the first name "Richard" or "Brian".  To do so, simply separate each name with a comma (,).
Ex: "fname:Richard,Brian"

You can also define multiple fields.  To search for both "Brian Maurer" and "Richard Maurer" for example use:
"fname:Richard,Brian sname:Maurer"

Put a "-" in front of a term to exclude it from your search.  You can put a "-" before both modifiers ("fname","sname",etc) and search terms.
Legal uses include, but might not be limited to:
"-fname:Richard sname:Maurer"
"fname:Brian sname:-Maurer"
Double negatives ("-fname:-Brian") will be treated as a positive.
